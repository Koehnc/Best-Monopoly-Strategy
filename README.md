# Best-Monopoly-Strategy

Monopoly isn't a game of chance, and I am interest to use Monte Carlo simulations and Neural Networks to determine which squares should I buy in order to beat my friends. It should also be able to tell if the strategy varies depending on factors such as number of players. Trading is considered subjective, so it is excluded, but other than that, the rules should follow the actual game of monopoly
